## Tools used

* [Cloud9 IDE](http://c9.io/)

## Difficulties

Adding the About Me section - I wanted to use JSON and Handlebars straightaway.
Not sure whether the image for "photo" section should take responsive web development into account.
It said no libraries - does this include not using the CSS that is currently implemented?
