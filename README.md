## Tools used

* [Cloud9 IDE](http://c9.io/)

## Difficulties

Adding the About Me section - I wanted to use JSON and Handlebars straightaway.

Not sure whether the image for "photo" section should take responsive web development into account.

The Task stipulated "no libraries" - does this include not using the CSS that is currently implemented?

Task 10: Task Runner asked for me to add my dependencies to the package.json - wasn't sure if 
this meant create an entirely seperate module and register it with NPM or to add to current
package.json.
